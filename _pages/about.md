I am a final year PhD student in statistics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Judith Rousseau](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Robin Ryder](https://sites.google.com/site/robryd/) and [Christian Robert](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~xian/). My research focuses on Bayesian statistics (both theoretical and computational), and applications to linguistics.
